  sentences:
  - You've just picked up the feather - after you jump, you will fall slower and
    will let you reach longer jumps!
  - Remember! You can use only 1 item at a time. In order to switch items, click
    their numbers on your keyboard.
  - 'Tip: To make your feathered jumps efficient, first jump from a straight surface
    and after you start falling slowly, go in the desired direction.'
